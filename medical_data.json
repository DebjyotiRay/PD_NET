        "text": "Insights into dietary phytochemicals targeting Parkinson's disease key genes and pathways: A network pharmacology approach. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurological disease associated with the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Oxidative stress is a key player in instigating apoptosis in dopaminergic neurons. To improve the survival of neurons many dietary phytochemicals have gathered significant attention recently. Thus, the present study implements a comprehensive network pharmacology approach to unravel the mechanisms of action of dietary phytochemicals that benefit disease management. A literature search was performed to identify ligands (i.e., comprising dietary phytochemicals and Food and Drug Administration pre-approved PD drugs) in the PubMed database. Targets associated with selected ligands were extracted from the search tool for interactions of chemicals (STITCH) database. Then, the construction of a gene-gene interaction (GGI) network, analysis of hub-gene, functional and pathway enrichment, associated transcription factors, miRNAs, ligand-target interaction network, docking were performed using various bioinformatics tools together with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The database search resulted in 69 ligands and 144 unique targets. GGI and subsequent topological measures indicate histone acetyltransferase p300 (EP300), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)2, and CREB-binding protein (CREBBP) as hub genes. Neurodegeneration, MAPK signaling, apoptosis, and zinc binding are key pathways and gene ontology terms. hsa-miR-5692a and SCNA gene-associated transcription factors interact with all the 3 hub genes. Ligand-target interaction (LTI) network analysis suggest rasagiline and baicalein as candidate ligands targeting MAPK1. Rasagiline and baicalein form stable complexes with the Y205, K330, and V173 residues of MAPK1. Computational molecular insights suggest that baicalein and rasagiline are promising preclinical candidates for PD management.",

        "text": "A sporadic Parkinson's disease model via silencing of the ubiquitin-proteasome/E3 ligase component,\u00a0SKP1A. Our and other's laboratory microarray-derived transcriptomic studies in human PD substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) samples have opened an avenue to concentrate on potential gene intersections or cross-talks along the dopaminergic (DAergic) neurodegenerative cascade in sporadic PD (SPD). One emerging gene candidate identified was SKP1A (p19, S-phase kinase-associated protein 1A), found significantly decreased in the SNpc as confirmed later at the protein level. SKP1 is part of the Skp1, Cullin 1, F-box protein (SCF) complex, the largest known class of sophisticated ubiquitin-proteasome/E3-ligases and was found to directly interact with FBXO7, a gene defective in PARK15-linked PD. This finding has led us to the hypothesis that a targeted site-specific reduction of Skp1 levels in DAergic neuronal cell culture and animal systems may result in a progressive loss of DAergic neurons and hopefully recreate motor disabilities in animals. The second premise considers the possibility that both intrinsic and extrinsic factors (e.g., manipulation of selected genes and mitochondria impairing toxins), alleged to play central roles in DAergic neurodegeneration in PD, may act in concert as modifiers of Skp1 deficiency-induced phenotype alterations ('dual-hit' hypothesis of neurodegeneration). To examine a possible role of Skp1 in DAergic phenotype, we have initially knocked down the expression of SKP1A gene in an embryonic mouse SN-derived cell line (SN4741) with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviruses (LVs). The deficiency of SKP1A closely recapitulated cardinal features of the DAergic pathology of human PD, such as decreased expression of DAergic phenotypic markers and cell cycle aberrations. Furthermore, the knocked down cells displayed a lethal phenotype when induced to differentiate exhibiting proteinaceous round inclusion structures, which were almost identical in composition to human Lewy bodies, a hallmark of PD. These findings support a role for Skp1 in neuronal phenotype, survival, and differentiation. The identification of Skp1 as a key player in DAergic neuron function suggested that a targeted site-specific reduction of Skp1 levels in mice SNpc may result in a progressive loss of DAergic neurons and terminal projections in the striatum. The injected LV SKP1shRNA to mouse SN resulted in decreased expression of Skp1 protein levels within DAergic neurons and loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-IR) in both SNpc and striatum that was accompanied by time-dependent motor disabilities. The reduction of the vertical movements, that is rearing, may be reminiscent of the early occurrence of hypokinesia and axial, postural instability in PD. According to the 'dual-hit' hypothesis of neurodegenerative diseases, it is predicted that gene-gene and/or gene-environmental factors would act in concert or sequentially to propagate the pathological process of PD. Our findings are compatible with this conjecture showing that the genetic vulnerability caused by knock down of SKP1A renders DAergic SN4741 cells especially sensitive to genetic reduction of Aldh1 and exposure to the external stressors MPP+ and DA, which have been implicated in PD pathology. Future consideration should be given in manipulation SKP1A expression as therapeutic window, via its induction genetically or pharmacological, to prevent degeneration of the nigra striatal dopamine neurons, since UPS is defective.",

The effects of one genetic factor upon Parkinson's disease (PD) risk may be modified by other genetic factors. Such gene-gene interaction (G\u00d7G) could explain some of the 'missing heritability' of PD and the reduced penetrance of known PD risk variants. Using the largest single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data set currently available for PD (18,688 patients), provided by the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium, we studied G\u00d7G with a case-only (CO) design. To this end, we paired each of 90 SNPs previously reported to be associated with PD with one of 7.8 million quality-controlled SNPs from a genome-wide panel. Support of any putative G\u00d7G interactions found was sought by the analysis of independent genotype-phenotype and experimental data. A total of 116 significant pairwise SNP genotype associations were identified in PD cases, pointing towards G\u00d7G. The most prominent associations involved a region on chromosome 12q containing SNP rs76904798, which is a non-coding variant of the LRRK2 gene. It yielded the lowest interaction p-value overall with SNP rs1007709 in the promoter region of the SYT10 gene (interaction OR\u2009=\u20091.80, 95% CI: 1.65-1.95, p\u2009=\u20092.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910-43). SNPs around SYT10 were also associated with the age-at-onset of PD in an independent cohort of carriers of LRRK2 mutation p.G2019S. Moreover, SYT10 gene expression during neuronal development was found to differ between cells from affected and non-affected p.G2019S carriers. G\u00d7G interaction on PD risk, involving the LRRK2 and SYT10 gene regions, is biologically plausible owing to the known link between PD and LRRK2, its involvement in neural plasticity, and the contribution of SYT10 to the exocytosis of secretory vesicles in neurons.",

Genetic variants of SMPD1 are also overrepresented in PD cohorts, whereas a reduction of its encoded enzyme (acid sphingomyelinase or ASM) activity is linked to an earlier age of PD onset. Despite both converging on the ceramide pathway, how the combined deficiencies of both enzymes might interact to modulate PD has yet to be explored. Therefore, we created a double-knockout (DKO) zebrafish line for both gba1 (or gba) and smpd1 to test for an interaction in vivo, hypothesising an exacerbation of phenotypes in the DKO line compared to those for single mutants. Unexpectedly, DKO zebrafish maintained conventional swimming behaviour and had normalised neuronal gene expression signatures compared to those of single mutants. We further identified rescue of mitochondrial Complexes I and IV in DKO zebrafish. Despite having an unexpected rescue effect, our results confirm ASM as a modifier of GBA1 deficiency in vivo.

However, these network-based methods only use molecular networks, ignoring brain connectome data, which have been widely used in many brain-related studies. In our study, we propose a novel framework, named brainMI, for integrating brain connectome data and molecular-based gene association networks to predict brain disease genes.

Here, we examined the association between VDR rs2228570 polymorphism and PD risk in a Chinese population.

A TaqMan genotyping assay was applied to identify VDR rs2228570 polymorphism. The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) was calculated for both groups with a Chi-square (\u03c72) test. The sample power was calculated with Power V3.0. The crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for sporadic PD in relation to VDR rs2228570 polymorphism were calculated using a logistic regression analysis. The minor A allele frequency was 0.42 and 0.48 in the control and PD groups, respectively. A allele carriers of rs2228570 were associated with an increased overall risk of PD as well as early-onset PD (EOPD) in the allele and additive genetic models. Stratification analyses showed similar results in male subjects in the allele and additive genetic models, but only in the additive genetic model in female subjects. In conclusion, our study suggests that the VDR rs2228570 A allele is associated with an increased risk of PD in a Chinese population.

In genetic epidemiological studies, family history data are collected on relatives of study participants and used to estimate the age-specific risk of disease for individuals who carry a causal mutation. However, a family member's genotype data may not be collected because of the high cost of in-person interview to obtain blood sample or death of a relative. Previously, efficient nonparametric genotype-specific risk estimation in censored mixture data has been proposed without considering covariates. With multiple predictive risk factors available, risk estimation requires a multivariate model to account for additional covariates that may affect disease risk simultaneously. Therefore, it is important to consider the role of covariates in genotype-specific distribution estimation using family history data. We propose an estimation method that permits more precise risk prediction by controlling for individual characteristics and incorporating interaction effects with missing genotypes in relatives, and thus, gene-gene interactions and gene-environment interactions can be handled within the framework of a single model. We examine performance of the proposed methods by simulations and apply them to estimate the age-specific cumulative risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in carriers of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation using first-degree relatives who are at genetic risk for PD.

Many genetic variants have been linked to familial or sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), among which those identified in PARK16, BST1, SNCA, LRRK2, GBA and MAPT genes have been demonstrated to be the most common risk factors worldwide. Moreover, complex gene-gene and gene-environment interactions have been highlighted in PD pathogenesis. Compared to studies focusing on the predisposing effects of genes, there is a relative lack of research investigating how these genes and their interactions influence the clinical profiles of PD. In a cohort consisting of 2,011 Chinese Han PD patients, we selected 9 representative variants from the 6 above-mentioned common PD genes to analyze their main and epistatic effects on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) stage of PD. With multiple linear regression models adjusting for medication status, disease duration, gender and age at onset, none of the variants displayed significant main effects on UPDRS or the H-Y scores.

The clinical utility of all these models was assessed by plotting receiver operating characteristics curves where in area under the curve (AUC) was used as an index of diagnostic utility of the model.

In view of documented evidence demonstrating the association of dopaminergic metabolism and neurotransmission with Parkinson's disease (PD), a case-control study was conducted to investigate the impact of particular polymorphisms in the catechol O-methyl transferase (COMT) H108L, monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) int 13 A>G, dopamine transporter 1 (DAT1) A1215G, dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) Taq1A, DRD2 Taq1B and DRD2 Taq1D genes on the susceptibility to PD. PCR-RFLP method was used for the genetic analysis. The COMT H108L polymorphism increased PD risk by 1.4-fold (95%CI: 1.02-1.98), whereas reduced risk was observed with MAOB int 13 A>G polymorphism (OR: 0.77, 95%CI: 0.51-0.99).

In this paper, we propose an expandable framework for gene prioritization that can integrate multiple heterogeneous data sources by taking advantage of a unified graphic representation.

A case study using Parkinson disease (PD) has identified four candidate genes (UBB, SEPT5, GPR37 and TH) that ranked higher than our adaptive threshold, all of which are involved in the PD pathway.

Coding and tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (27 NOS1, 18 NOS2A, and five NOS3 SNPs) were genotyped in families with PD (1,065 cases and 1,180 relative and other controls) and were tested for allelic associations with PD using the association in the presence of linkage test and the pedigree disequilibrium test (PDT), allelic associations with age-at-onset (AAO) using the quantitative transmission disequilibrium test, and interactions using the multifactor dimensionality reduction-PDT. Gene-environment interactions involving cigarette smoking, caffeine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and pesticides were examined using generalized estimating equations in participants with environmental data available.

There was no compelling statistical evidence for gene-gene interactions. However, of the significantly associated SNPs, interactions were found between pesticides and the NOS1 SNPs rs12829185, rs1047735, and rs2682826 (range of p = 0.012-0.034) and between smoking and the NOS2A SNPs rs2248814 (p = 0.021) and rs1060826 (p = 0.013).

The fibroblast growth factor 20 (FGF20) and monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) genes are associated with Parkinson Disease (PD) risk and both are in the dopamine bio-pathway. Therefore, we investigated the joint effect between polymorphisms in the FGF20 and MAOB genes for evidence of interaction contributing to PD risk. Fourteen polymorphisms (eight for FGF20, six for MAOB) were genotyped in 736 families and analyzed using conditional logistic regression (CLR). Significant two-locus interactions were found in females between the polymorphisms rs1721100 of FGF20 and rs1799836 of MAOB, and between the polymorphisms rs1721082 of FGF20 and rs1799836 of MAOB. The risk alleles for each SNP identified from CLR, rs1721100 C, rs1721082 T and rs1799836 A, are consistent with previous reports. Using indicator variables for the SNP genotypes, rs1721100 GC with rs1799836 AA showed significant interaction (P = 0.021), compared with the reference group rs1721100 GG with rs1799836 GG. Using an allele-dose model for the risk alleles, rs1721100 and rs1799836 showed significant interaction (P = 0.019). We found similar interaction results between rs1721082 and rs1799836. In conclusion, variants in FGF20 and MAOB show evidence of statistical interactions, which emphasizes the importance of considering them jointly in genetic analysis of PD and illustrates potential patterns of biological interaction contributing to PD risk.",

The recent identification of a common genetic variant (LRRK2 G2385R) which is associated with a two-fold increased risk of sporadic Parkinson's Disease (PD) in two independent Chinese populations in Singapore and Taiwan has generated considerable excitement. Thus far, this variant appears specific for the Asian population, emphasising further that ethnic-specific effects should be considered in genetic association studies. Cautious optimism is advised as we await more scientific studies and clarification if this risk variant is specific to ethnic Chinese race. Our in-vitro studies suggest the Gly2385Arg variant is biologically relevant and it might act through pro-apoptotic mechanisms, especially under cellular stresses. This may provide a partial explanation why some carriers develop the disease while others do not. The presence of other epigenetic factors, gene-gene and gene-environmental interaction could modulate the phenotype expression. Further validation of these findings would be needed to confirm this variant as the single most important common genetic risk factor in ethnic Chinese and/or Asian PD patients. The identification of the LRRK2 Gly2385Arg variant could potentially facilitate the development of clinical, bioimaging, genetic and biological biomarkers, useful in the monitoring and neuroprotective therapy in asymptomatic individuals.",

We previously identified frequent deletion/insertion polymorphisms in the 20-alanine homopolymer stretch of PHOX2B (PMX2B), the gene for a transcription factor that plays important roles in the development of oculomotor nerves and catecholaminergic neurons and regulates the expression of both tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase genes. An association was detected between gene polymorphisms and overall schizophrenia, and more specifically, schizophrenia with ocular misalignment. These prior results implied the existence of other schizophrenia susceptibility genes that interact with PHOX2B to increase risk of the combined phenotype. ASCL1 was considered as a candidate interacting partner of PHOX2B, as ASCL1 is a transcription factor that co-regulates catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes with PHOX2B. The genetic contributions of PHOX2B and ASCL1 were examined separately, along with epistatic interactions with broader candidate phenotypes. These phenotypes included not only schizophrenia, but also bipolar affective disorder and Parkinson's disease (PD), each of which involve catecholaminergic function. The current case-control analyses detected nominal associations between polyglutamine length variations in ASCL1 and PD (P=0.018), but supported neither the previously observed weak association between PHOX2B and general schizophrenia, nor other gene-disease correlations. Logistic regression analysis revealed the effect of ASCL1 dominant x PHOX2B additive (P=0.008) as an epistatic gene-gene interaction increasing risk of PD. ASCL1 controls development of the locus coeruleus (LC), and accumulating evidence suggests that the LC confers protective effects against the dopaminergic neurodegeneration inherent in PD.
